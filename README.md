# [The Odin Project: CV Application](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application)
# Introduction
Congratulations on embarking on your first React project! This project involves creating a small CV (Curriculum Vitae) application, serving as an excellent opportunity to apply the fundamental concepts you've learned in React. Despite being a beginner-level project, it encompasses various basic concepts without overwhelming complexity.

# Assignment
Follow these steps to complete the assignment:

1. **Create a New React Project:**
   Set up a new React project using a tool like `create-react-app` or any method of your choice.

2. **Component Structure:**
   Plan and structure your application into components. The following sections should be included in your CV application:

   - General Information: Name, Email, and Phone Number.
   - Educational Experience: School Name, Title of Study, and Date of Study.
   - Practical Experience: Company Name, Position Title, Main Responsibilities, Date of Employment.

3. **Button Functionality:**
   Implement Edit and Submit buttons for each section or the entire CV. These buttons should serve the following purposes:
   
   - **Submit Button:** Save and display the input field values in HTML elements.
   - **Edit Button:** Display the input fields with previously entered information as default values. Allow users to edit and resubmit the content.

4. **State and Props Usage:**
   Make extensive use of state and props concepts. Ensure a clear understanding of how these concepts work together to manage and pass data in your React application.

5. **Directory Structure:**
   Organize your project by creating a `components` directory under the `src` directory for your React components. Additionally, include a `styles` directory under `src` to store your CSS files. Import these styles in your component files as needed.

6. **Push and Deployment:**
   Push the completed project to a version control system (e.g., GitHub) and consider deploying it using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
